### Tasks
- Notebook Meeting. Discussed how to format notebook and read over guidelines to make sure that Jekyll will work. Reviewed notebooks from previous years, pointed out changes that could be made to make it better.
-   Uh

### Reflections
- Jekyll will probably work, but if need be content can be copied and pasted into a word document for printing.
