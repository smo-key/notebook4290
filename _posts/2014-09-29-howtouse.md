Welcome to the Jekyll guide.  My name is `smo-key the bear` and I am your guide through the simplicity known as Jekyll.

I recommend you read along [here][thisfile].  Click the `Raw` button to see what this file looks like in text while you read this live on the website.

## First Things First

*Repository (n.): a source of knowledge or wisdom, in this case our FTC notebook.*

## Getting Started

First, request access to the [repository][repo] by sending `smo-key` an email.

Once you have unruly access to the notebook, open up [Github][github] and navigate to our repository at [https://github.com/smo-key/notebook4290][repo].

Then, find the `_posts` directory.  Click it.

## Creating Your First Post

Press the `+` button on Github next to the current directory (`notebook4290\_posts`) to create a new file.

Then, name the file like this: `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.md`.  Example: `2014-09-29-howtouse.md`.

Finally, type your content.

## Content Guide

### Basic Syntax
- `This is text.` = This is text
- `*Itatics*` = *Italics*
- `**Bold**` = **Bold**
- `***Both***` = ***Both***
- `------` or `---` or `****`, etc. : Horizontal line
- If you want to use an asterisk (`*`) in a document without affecting formatting, do this: `\*`.
- `\*asterisk\* not bold **bold**` = \*asterisk\* not bold **bold**
- `Also, **\#HASHTAG!**` = Also, **\#HASHTAG**!
- Leave an empty line after text to get **another paragraph**

### Headings
- `# Heading 1`
- `## Heading 2`
- `### Heading 3`
- `#### Heading 4`
- `##### Heading 5`
- `###### Heading 6 (Punitive)`

### Lists
{% highlight text %}
**Bulleted List**

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3
{% endhighlight %}
**Bulleted List**

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

{% highlight text %}
**Numbered List**

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
{% endhighlight %}
**Numbered List**

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

### Tagged Links

A link has two parts, a *tag* and a *link*.
First, a *tag* is created like this: `[Tag]: http://webpage.com`.  Tags are placed at the **bottom** of the document.
Then, anywhere in the document, you can create a *link* like this: `[Text to display][Tag]`.

**Example:**

`Let's go to [an awesome website!][Google]`

`[Google]: http://google.com`

Let's go to [an awesome website!][Google]

### Untagged Links

**Instant Link:** `[Google][]` = `[Google][Google]` = [Google][]

**Hyperlink:** `<http://google.com>` = <http://google.com>

### Codeblocks
- `` `Code` `` = `Code`

{% highlight html %}
<html>
<body>
<h1 style="color:#f00">Codeblock of HTML</p>
This is an HTML codeblock!  Look at the pretty colors!
</body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

To see how that's done, look at the raw Markdown file.  You can replace the `html` tag with `text` (for random stuff), `c` (for RobotC), et cetera...

### Images

First, you have to upload an image using the [Handy-Dandy Image Upload Tool][imagetool].  (I would bookmark this if I were you.)  Simply find the image on your desktop, give it a name, and press upload!

Once you have your image uploaded, it is inserted almost the same way as a tagged link (the tool will generate this for you, just **copy and paste**.

`![image4.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/image4.png)` = ![image4.png]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/image4.png)

If you want to insert your own images, you can do so in the same way.

`![Help Text](Location)`, such as `![Kittens](http://somekitten.website/kitten.img)`

## That's All, Folks!

When you're done writing your file, press the green `Commit Changes` at the bottom of the page!  And you're done!  Go and check it out on the website, it should be published within 30 seconds!

Enjoy Jekylling!  (Just try to stay away from Mr. Hyde.)
